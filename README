This week was my first experience with python, data scraping, utilizing html for displaying data, and csv manipulation.

To run this project, run BasicBokeh.py.

_________________________________

Using OpenCV, this game tracks the user's face, using the default camera, and displays the image back to you. It shows the user a circle on the "center" of his/her face and a randomly located target square.

The goal of the game is to move the center of your face to the target square as many times as possible before the timer runs out.

This game was designed to run on my MacBook Pro Mid-2015 with the stock camera. The game may not run as intended with other cameras or screens with different pixel densities.
